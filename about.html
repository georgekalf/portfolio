      <div class="about-box">
        <p>
          I’m a tech enthusiast with a strong interest in how data, analytics and software can be combined to solve
          intricate real-world challenges. My background bridges Marketing & Communications and Business Analytics,
          which means I care as much about the quality of the analysis as I do about how clearly the story is told.
        </p>

        <p>
          Professionally, I focus on data analytics engineering: designing and rebuilding data pipelines,
          automating reporting and experimentation workflows, and developing models that support product and
          strategy decisions. I have hands-on experience with projects spanning machine learning, deep learning,
          natural language processing, network analytics and data visualisation, from initial scoping through to
          stakeholder delivery.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am proficient in Python (including scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Matplotlib, NLTK,
          spaCy, Selenium and BeautifulSoup), SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL), R, SPSS, Excel and Google Sheets, as well as
          the Google Sheets Query function and a range of modern data tooling. I am comfortable working with APIs,
          building analyses in notebooks, and productionising solutions into reliable, maintainable workflows.
        </p>

        <p>
          My experience includes projects such as predicting hotel booking cancellations and segmenting guests,
          detecting fraud using neural networks, building R Shiny applications, analysing the impact of AI adoption
          on trading floors, and creating dashboards and pipelines that support day-to-day decision-making.
          Across all of these, I enjoy working closely with stakeholders to clarify the problem, define measurable
          outcomes and iterate towards solutions that are both technically sound and genuinely useful.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am always keen to learn, experiment with new tools and approaches, and collaborate with people from
          different disciplines. Whether the challenge is cleaning messy operational data, designing a model,
          or communicating results to non-technical audiences, I aim to make the path from data to action as
          smooth and transparent as possible.
