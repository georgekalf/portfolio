        <p>
          I’m a data analytics engineer focused on building end-to-end data products: from ingestion and
          transformation, through modelling and analysis, to clear outputs that teams can actually use.
          I enjoy working at the intersection of data engineering, data science and analytics, where the goal
          is not just to build something clever, but to deliver something reliable and measurable.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my current role at Ishango I work with multi-million row datasets across several clients, rebuilding
          and optimising ETL pipelines using tools such as SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, DuckDB, & Parquet files, and deploying them on Azure.
          I design and maintain Azure Functions and database logic that keep data flows robust and performant,
          and I integrate external systems via APIs to keep operational data in sync and reduce manual work.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the analytics and BI side, I build Power BI dashboards and reporting layers that support day-to-day
          decision making for internal teams and clients. I expose analytical logic through FastAPI endpoints and
          SQL workflows, so that insights and metrics can be reused across applications instead of being locked
          into a single report. I’m comfortable owning the full lifecycle of these solutions: scoping the problem,
          designing the data model, implementing, testing and iterating based on feedback.
        </p>

        <p>
          My technical toolkit includes Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Matplotlib,
          NLTK, spaCy, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, FastAPI), SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL), R and SPSS, as well as version control,
          data visualisation libraries (Seaborn, Plotly, Matplotlib) and modern cloud tooling (Microsoft Azure). I have experience working with APIs, scheduling
          and automation, and I care a lot about making pipelines observable and maintainable rather than just
          “working once”.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond pure engineering, I’ve worked on a range of machine learning and analytics projects: time-series
          forecasting for wind turbine health, autoencoder-based fraud detection, hotel booking cancellation
          prediction and guest segmentation, customer RFM analysis, an ML-driven R Shiny app for drug
          classification, and network analytics to study how AI knowledge spreads on a trading floor. These projects
          span classic supervised learning, unsupervised clustering, deep learning and NLP, and they all share the
          same goal of turning complex data into practical insights.
        </p>

        <p>
          I enjoy collaborating with product, business and technical stakeholders, translating questions into
          well-defined analytical problems and then into concrete solutions. Whether that means re-architecting
          a pipeline, designing a model or mentoring a junior analyst, I try to keep the focus on clarity,
          reliability and long-term impact rather than quick wins only.
